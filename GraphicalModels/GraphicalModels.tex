\chapter{Graphical Models}
Offer intro here. Some things to definitely cover:

- what is a DGM
- why we need them
- we're going to use them extensively in the next couple chapters, more broadly in any kind of complex modeling
- useful as a didactic tool
- not going to cover undirected graphical models

\section{Motivation}
Flesh out the ideas offered in the intro here, ML cube, look forward to some use cases where DGMs are useful. Touch on bayesian networks and properties of conditional independence.

\section{Directed Graphical Models (Bayesian Networks)}
Some things to definitely cover in this section:

\subsection{Joint Probability Distributions}
- specifying joint probability distributions
- how DGMs are constructed (distr -> dgm and dgm -> distr)

\subsection{Generative Models}
- generative models and ancestral sampling

\subsection{Understanding Complexity}
- complexity implications for different factorizations of joint distributions
- sharing parameters as a means of reducing complexity
- touch on goal of finding areas where there isn't dependence (and thus less complexity, size of probability table argument)

\subsection{Example?}
- we could do an example of some sort in here

\section{Conditional Independence}
Touch on how:

\subsection{Independence and D-Separation}
- we can use DGMs to determine independence properties for a given model
- run through different cases of DGMs and which imply independence, dependence, "explaining away"
- D-separation definition
- do an example in here?

\section{Naive Bayes}
- naive bayes example (maybe this goes in the previous section? but I think it can come here as an example)
- this is ultimately a topic that builds off the previous two, and I think it's important enough as a model choice to include it's own section
- do some sort of example in here?

\section{Conclusion}
concluding thoughts of DGMs, where we're going from here
