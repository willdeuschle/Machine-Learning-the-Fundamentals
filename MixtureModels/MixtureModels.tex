\chapter{Mixture Models}
In this chapter we will be exploring what are known as mixture models. The idea behind mixture models is quite intuitive: the real world produces data resulting from a combination of different forces. It should then be possible to model these forces individually and determine how they mix together to form the individual units of data that we observe. We will be diving into the details of the mathematic and statistical ideas underpinning mixture models, as well as how they can be used.
